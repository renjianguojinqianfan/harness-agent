# CLAUDE.md - harness-agent

> **Claude Code / Claude Desktop Quick Reference**
> Full workflow details: `AGENTS.md`

## Project Context

**harness-agent** —   
**Maintainer**: harness-init | **Type**: cli

- Deep context lives in `docs/context.md`
- State of truth: `.harness/progress.json`
- Templates: `.harness/templates/plan_template.json`

## Constraints

| Rule | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Function length | <= 30 lines |
| File length | <= 200 lines |
| Test coverage | >= 85% (enforced by `pytest-cov`) |
| Auto-fix attempts | Max 2 per error, then rollback |
| One session | One atomic task |

## Common Commands

```bash
make verify    # lint (ruff) + tests (pytest), coverage >= 85%
make fix       # auto-fix linting; MUST re-run `make verify` after
```

## Quick Rules

- **DO** read `docs/context.md` before architectural decisions
- **DO** run `make verify` after every change
- **DON'T** commit failing code; don't fix unrelated code during task
- **DON'T** add abstractions for single-use cases
- **DON'T** execute shell commands without human review
